Trevor Drayton and Brendan Mierau's project for SENG3210 (Applied Software Engineering) is an android application called the Online Voting System (OVS).

The purpose of the OVS is to allow for decision makers to get insights and votes on different topics while maintaining physical distancing due to the COVID-19 epidemic. The OVS achieves this by allowing users to log into the application on their phone and vote.

The OVS has two types of users that can log in, the "voters" and the "managers". Voters can view different topics, select them, and vote for any of the options presented to them. Managers can create topics, delete topics, and see how many votes each topic has for its voting options.

To login as a manager: try username u1 and password u1.

To login as a voter: try username u2 and password u2, or u3 and p3.
